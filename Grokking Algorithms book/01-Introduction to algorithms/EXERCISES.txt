1.1 Suppose you have a sorted list of 128 names, and you’re searching
through it using binary search. What’s the maximum number of
steps it would take?

Solution :-
Log2(128)=??
2^7=128
maximum number of steps it would take =7
--------
1.2 Suppose you double the size of the list. What’s the maximum
number of steps now?

Solution :-
log2(128*2)=??
2^8=256
maximum number of steps it would take =8
