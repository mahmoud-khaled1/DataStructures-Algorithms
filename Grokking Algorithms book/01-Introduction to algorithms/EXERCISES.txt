1.1 Suppose you have a sorted list of 128 names, and you’re searching
through it using binary search. What’s the maximum number of
steps it would take?

Solution :-
Log2(128)=??
2^7=128
maximum number of steps it would take =7
--------
1.2 Suppose you double the size of the list. What’s the maximum
number of steps now?

Solution :-
log2(128*2)=??
2^8=256
maximum number of steps it would take =8
--------
1.3 You have a name, and you want to find the person’s phone number
in the phone book. 

Solution :-
O(n)  if we search using Linear search             :where n is number of operations .
O(log n ) if we search using Binary search     :where n is number of operations .
-------
1.4 You have a phone number, and you want to find the person’s name
in the phone book. (Hint: You’ll have to search through the whole
book!)

Solution :-
O( n)  where n is number of operations .
------
1.5 You want to read the numbers of every person in the phone book.

Solution :-
O(n)           :where n is number of operations .
------
1.6 You want to read the numbers of just the As. (This is a tricky one!
It involves concepts that are covered more in chapter 4. Read the
answer—you may be surprised!)

Solution :-
O(n )  where n is number of operations .
