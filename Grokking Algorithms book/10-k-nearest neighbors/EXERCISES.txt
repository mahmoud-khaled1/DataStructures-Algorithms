10.1 )In the Netflix example, you calculated the distance between two
different users using the distance formula. But not all users rate
movies the same way. Suppose you have two users, Yogi and Pinky,
who have the same taste in movies. But Yogi rates any movie he
likes as a 5, whereas Pinky is choosier and reserves the 5s for
only the best. They’re well matched, but according to the distance
algorithm, they aren’t neighbors. How would you take their
different rating strategies into account?

solution :-
You could use something called normalization. You look at the average rating for each person and use it to scale their ratings.
 For example, you might notice that Pinky’s average rating is 3, whereas Yogi’s average rating is 3.5.
 So you bump up Pinky’s ratings a little, until her average rating is 3.5 as well. Then you can compare their ratings on the same scale.

10.2 )Suppose Netflix nominates a group of “influencers.” For example,
Quentin Tarantino and Wes Anderson are influencers on Netflix,
so their ratings count for more than a normal user’s. How would
you change the recommendations system so it’s biased toward the
ratings of influencers?

solution :-
You could give more weight to the ratings of the influencers when using KNN. 
Suppose you have three neighbors: Joe, Dave, and Wes Anderson (an influencer). 
They rated Caddyshack a 3, a 4, and a 5, respectively. Instead of just taking the average of their ratings (3 + 4 + 5 / 3 = 4 stars), 
you could give Wes Anderson’s rating more weight: 3 + 4 + 5 + 5 + 5 / 5 = 4.4 stars.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
10.3 Netflix has millions of users. The earlier example looked at the five
closest neighbors for building the recommendations system. Is this
too low? Too high? 

Solution :-
It’s too low. If you look at fewer neighbors, there’s a bigger chance that the results will be skewed.
 A good rule of thumb is, if you have N users, you should look at sqrt(N) neighbors.
