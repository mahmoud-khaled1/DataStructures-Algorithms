8.1 You work for a furniture company, and you have to ship furniture
all over the country. You need to pack your truck with boxes. All
the boxes are of different sizes, and you’re trying to maximize the
space you use in each truck. How would you pick boxes to maximize
space? Come up with a greedy strategy. Will that give you the
optimal solution?

Solution :-
A greedy strategy would be to pick the largest box that will fit in the remaining space,
 and repeat until you can’t pack any more boxes. 
No, this won’t give you the optimal solution.

8.2 You’re going to Europe, and you have seven days to see everything
you can. You assign a point value to each item (how much you want 
to see it) and estimate how long it takes. How can you maximize the
point total (seeing all the things you really want to see) during your
stay? Come up with a greedy strategy. Will that give you the optimal
solution? 

Solution :-
Keep picking the activity with the highest point value that you can still do in the time you have left. 
Stop when you can’t do anything else.
No, this won’t give you the optimal solution.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
For each of these algorithms, say whether it’s a greedy algorithm or not.
8.3 Quicksort  ===> NO
8.4 Breadth-first search===> NO
8.5 Dijkstra’s algorithm===>Yes

8.6 A postman needs to deliver to 20 homes. He needs to find the
shortest route that goes to all 20 homes. Is this an NP-complete
problem?

YES

---------------------------------------------------------------------
8.7 Finding the largest clique in a set of people (a clique is a set of people
who all know each other). Is this an NP-complete problem?

Yes.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
8.8 You’re making a map of the USA, and you need to color adjacent
states with different colors. You have to find the minimum number
of colors you need so that no two adjacent states are the same color.
Is this an NP-complete problem?

Yes.
